# TF-IDF
This is a simple IF-IDF implementation, aimed at easy and quick experimentation and concept understanding. 
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. It is used to measure how important a word is to a particular document. 

TF : How frequently a string occrs in a particular document.
IDF : It measures the importance of a string within the document
TF-IDF : TF * IDF

IDF reduces as the number of documents containing term increases
